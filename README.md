**A Mutual Pact of Trust &amp; Good Vibes**

Hey friend,

I want to share some cool, possibly sensitive stuff with you—things like ideas, plans, secrets, or other goodies that aren’t ready for the world yet. And I bet you might have some of your own. So, by reading this and continuing our conversation, we’re both agreeing to keep things between us. That means:

* **No Sharing** – If one of us shares something confidential, the other won’t spill the beans without permission.
* **No Using** – Neither of us will use the other’s confidential info for personal gain without a clear go-ahead.
* **No Leaking** – If something accidentally slips, we’ll both do our best to keep it contained.
This agreement is mutual and lasts forever (or at least until the info becomes public through no fault of ours). No signatures needed—just by continuing our conversation, we’re shaking hands on it. And while we could get legal if things go sideways, let’s just be decent humans and honor the trust.

Deal? 🤝

Now, let’s chat.
